# Exploratory_Air_Route_Analysis

Today, information technology goes beyond simply storing and displaying data.
The sub-discipline of data science, acquiring and evaluating data and generating knowledge from it, is becoming increasingly important.
Above all, in order to optimize corporate management in the economic environment,
to support decision-making or, in the context of marketing, even to identify and present striking facts. 
In this context, it is not only important what statements the data lead to, but also how they are visualized. The decisive factor here is 
to prepare the acquired data adequately for different interest groups. 
In the following, we will look at three visualization examples from the logistics industry. 
For this purpose, flight data is evaluated and prepared in different ways.

Approach

The first step is to define the framework for all following visualizations. 
The visual evaluations of flight data can address different interest groups, 
for example, the prospective customers or customers of the airline, 
who are interested in the offered flights and especially their delay and reliability. 
On the other hand, the airlines or airports themselves are also interested in a comparison with their competitors. 
In addition, the airline can draw conclusions about its own weaknesses and improvements by presenting its flight data. 
In the following, the stakeholders mentioned are addressed. 
In the representations, certain basic characteristics must be taken into account, 
as they are listed for example in Dieter Rams Design Rules (Rams, 2021). 
Of these, the most important for the following visualizations are the comprehensibility, the aesthetics and the innovation of the representation, 
as well as the honesty of the data are important. 
Another condition for the visualizations is the medium, 
through which they are presented. The following visualizations are web plots,
that could be found on a website, for example. 
Thus, there is no possibility to provide the audience with an oral explanation to the visualization or to allow direct queries.
Therefore, special care must be taken to include all the necessary information so that the viewer can draw his or her own conclusions. 
An advantage of the digital presentation is the possibility to include animations or interaction possibilities,
with which the viewer can navigate through the presentation and thus set his own focus.
This gives the viewer a so-called exploratory experience in which they can interact with the visualization. 
Since the data is exclusively flight data from the USA,
the plots are labeled in international language, since most of the addressees are either from the USA or interested in international travel.
or are interested in international travel.
