Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization

# Area of Exploratory Analysis
Today, information technology goes beyond simply storing and displaying data.
The sub-discipline of data science, acquiring and evaluating data and generating knowledge from it, is becoming increasingly important.
Above all, in order to optimize corporate management in the economic environment,
to support decision-making or, in the context of marketing, even to identify and present striking facts. 
In this context, it is not only important what statements the data lead to, but also how they are visualized. The decisive factor here is 
to prepare the acquired data adequately for different interest groups. 
In the following, we will look at three visualization examples from the logistics industry. 
For this purpose, flight data is evaluated and prepared in different ways.
